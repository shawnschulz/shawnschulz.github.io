	    Hello! I’m Shawn, a BA in Immunology from UC Berkeley and a current Molecular Science and Software Engineering MS student at UC Berkeley, currently located in Berkeley, CA. I chose to study the intersection between software engineering and molecular science because in my time as a data analyst and researcher in medicine and biology I noticed three main bottlenecks in tackling the top causes of mortality for humanity. The first was that clinical trials are where the vast majority of time is spent in research and where most good biology ideas stumble and fail. Better computational infrastructure can help lower costs in both time and money for new clinical trials by improving accuracy of target selection and narrowing a staggering number of hypotheses. The second was that production poses a major problem, even for relatively successful clinical trials. Speeding up and improving the precision of time intensive biological processes requires improvements in the computational systems and infrastructure that companies rely on, a doubly pressing problem for the biotech industry which often relies on older or non specialized technological frameworks. The third was that incurable diseases are poorly understood at the systemic level, even when some specific molecular mechanisms are well understood. Computational biology equips researchers with a tool well equipped to model the different levels of abstraction involved in a disease (molecular, proteomic, cellular, tissue wide), and systems level models can give a model for how incurable diseases or complications work where none exists. </p>
	    <p>

In my previous experiences I have worked to tackle these challenges. At my job as a Data Analyst at Stanford Medicine I developed a high performance computing pipeline for identifying mutations in cancer, narrowing thousands of uncertain targets to tens of precise ones and assisting in the procurement of hundreds of thousands of dollars in grants, with the potential to help speed up the production of targeted CAR-T cell therapy as well. I also helped to model the evolution of cancer and the development of lung cells using large datasets. As a machine learning researcher at Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research, I helped write statistical modeling software used to identify the genetic markers of COVID. The statistical models I worked on helped give a systems level view to cancer and COVID, and taught me that DNA and RNA aren't just letters in a text file but constantly moving three dimensional molecules. The need for software engineers who understand molecular biology problems is visible in the ever growing number of companies and investments in computational infrastructure in the biotech space. It makes me excited to pursue a masters and career in this area.
