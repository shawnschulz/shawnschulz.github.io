	    Iâ€™m Shawn, a BA in Immunology from, and a current Molecular Science and Software Engineering MS student at UC Berkeley. I'm a data and software engineer who specializes in high performance computing and statistical modeling for biomedical applications. I love the simple satisfaction that comes with building things and understanding how stuff works under the hood. 
	    </p>
	    <p>
	    In my time as a data engineer, I developed an HPC pipeline at Stanford which identified precise therapeutic targets from hundreds of thousands of candidate mutations. As a machine learning researcher at Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research, I helped develop a neural network model for classifying cell types and used it to characterize the gene expression of lung cells infected by SARS-CoV2. 
	    </p>
	    <p>
	    If that sounds interesting and you are interested in working together dont hesitate to reach out! I am currently open to exploring job opportunities in software and data engineering, business/research partnerships, and am working on my own projects to tackle interesting problems head on, which you can view below.
