	  Hello! I’m Shawn, a BA in Immunology from, and a current Molecular Science and Software Engineering MS student at UC Berkeley.  
 </p>
	    <p>
	    I'm a data and software engineer who specializes in high performance computing and statistical modeling for biomedical applications. I am especially interested in understanding complex systems and creating novel solutions to problems that humans face when these systems break down. My passion is rooted in understanding how humans work, from our brains and how we learn to how the smallest components of our tissues come together to create a living breathing person. Developing computational infrastructure complements this goal extremely well, providing the basis for novel applications and models for solving human problems. In my engineering and research work, I love the feeling of finding simple, high performance solutions to problems and writing software that people like to use. I believe that any project worth doing is a marathon, not a sprint, and quality and attention to detail are the most important and satisfying qualities to deliver software.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	    In my time as a data analyst and researcher in medicine and biology, I developed a high performance computing pipeline for identifying mutations in cancer, narrowing thousands of uncertain targets to tens of precise ones and assisting in the procurement of hundreds of thousands of dollars in grants. As a machine learning researcher at Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research, I helped develop a neural network model for classifying cell types, helping to characterize the gene expression of lung cells infected by SARS-CoV2. The software I wrote not only reduced costs and saved time for the organizations I was a part of, they enabled the discovery of cancer therapy targets in single cells that would have been impossible previously.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	    Teams can’t just have good individual managers and engineers: the current challenges in tech and biotech require us to be more than the sum of our parts. I would love to provide technical expertise in software engineering and modeling complex systems to your team. If you are excited about these problems as well, don’t hesitate to reach out! I am currently open to exploring job opportunities in software and data engineering, business/research partnerships, and am working on my own projects to tackle these problems head on, which you can view below.
