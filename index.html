        <p> Hello and welcome to my website! I'm Shawn, an aspiring software engineer and computational biologist.</p> 
        <p> My goal is to help develop computational infrastructure and machine learning models 
            to discover treatments and outline disease pathologies for incurable or high impact
            dieseases like cancer, heart disease and infectious diseases. In particular I like
            working with novel treatment mechanisms like CAR-T or gene therapy vectors. </p>
        <p> I am also interested in using machine learning to model a variety 
            of problems, as well as to automate tasks in biotechnology. 
        </p>
        <p> I am currently working on a CNC controlled micropipette tool and
            writing a transformer architecture based model for cancer pathway
            detection and protein solving.
            </p> 
        <p> In my free time I like biking, playing guitar and developing video games. </p>
