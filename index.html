	    Hello! I’m Shawn, a BA in Immunology from, and a current Molecular Science and Software Engineering MS student at UC Berkeley. In my time as a data analyst and researcher in medicine and biology I noticed three main bottlenecks in tackling the top causes of mortality for humanity. The first was that clinical trials are where the vast majority of time is spent in research and where most good biology ideas stumble and fail. The second was that production of novel biological products is consistently costly and time consuming, even for relatively successful clinical trials. The third was that incurable diseases are poorly understood at the systemic level, even when some specific molecular mechanisms are well understood. In my previous experiences I have worked to tackle these challenges. At my job as a Data Analyst at Stanford Medicine I developed a high performance computing pipeline for identifying mutations in cancer, narrowing thousands of uncertain targets to tens of precise ones and assisting in the procurement of hundreds of thousands of dollars in grants. As a machine learning researcher at Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research, I helped use a neural network model to outline how COVID pathology developed on a systems level.
 </p>
	    <p>
	    The need for software engineers who understand molecular biology problems is visible in the ever growing number of companies and investments in computational infrastructure in the biotech space. Teams can’t just have good individual researchers and engineers: the current challenges in biotechnology require us to be more than the sum of our parts. Knowledge of computer science and statistics combined with biology knowledge can provide vital information to help teams find ground truths and iterate better. 
	    </p>
	    <p>
	    If you are excited about these problems as well, don’t hesitate to reach out! I am currently open to exploring job opportunities and business/research partnerships, and am working on my own projects to tackle these problems head on, which you can view below.
